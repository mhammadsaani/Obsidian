## How JS works?
Everything in JS happens inside an ***Execution Context***

Execution Context:
It is like a big box and it has two components 
1. Memory (Variable Environment)
	In memory, variables and functions are stored in key value form
2. Code (Thread of Execution)
	Here, code is executed line by line

JavaScript is 
1. Synchronous (Start from top to bottom)
2. Single-threaded
language. (one code line at a time)
